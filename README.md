# Price_Prediction-
In this project, I will predict Price variable from dataset Computers in the Ecdat package using R. 
These following libraries are used: 
library(Ecdat)
library(gam)
library(randomForest)
I applied three predictive models namely: linear regression, GAM and bag trees. And calculate the mean square error MES to have the best model.
